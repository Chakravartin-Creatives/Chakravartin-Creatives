Collaboration Philosophy
We’re open to engineers, researchers, artists, and thinkers. No gatekeeping. If you care about culture, impact, and design, you're welcome here.

Vision
We believe that technology should serve storytelling, not strip it of soul. Artists deserve tools that protect their humanity and livelihood, not dilute it. 

This is tech with tenderness. AI as amplifier. Culture as code.

Let’s build something that lasts.
