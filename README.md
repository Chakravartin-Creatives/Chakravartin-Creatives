## 🤝 Collaboration Philosophy
We’re open to engineers, researchers, artists, and thinkers.  
No gatekeeping. If you care about culture, impact, and design — you're welcome here.

---

## 🔭 Vision
We believe technology should elevate storytelling, not extract its essence.  
Artists don’t need disruption — they need tools that honor their craft, protect their spirit, and support their futures.  
Our tools are built to preserve humanity, amplify creative reach, and sustain dignity.

This is not AI for disruption — this is AI for preservation. For evolution.  
Let’s build systems that serve people, not platforms.
